Scientists and engineers are surrounded by numbers.  Physical constants, values for 
the specific heat index or measures of strength or flexibility of some material, 
resistance of some component in an electrical device, etc., etc.
Most of these numbers come from some process that generated data and led to a calculuation
that produced the number.  Like this one \dots

\noindent Or maybe not quite like that one.

\section*{Thought experiment -- How many dimes?}
Here's a thought experiment for you.  Suppose a middle school class has collected a 
large number of dimes in a sack.  Before bringing the money to the bank, they would like
to estimate how many dimes they have (using tools and methods that 6th graders have at
their disposal).  You've been brought in to consult with them about how they should do this.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
What method would you suggest?  Why?
\item
What other methods would be possible?  What makes your proposed method better?
\item
For your favorite method and others, identify factors that lead the resulting estimate
to be different from the exact number of dimes in the sack.  
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Some important terms}

\begin{description}
	\item[estimand/measureand]{ The number we want to know.  In our example this is the number
		of dimes in the bag.  Typically this will be a number that describes some process
		or population, and typically it will be impossible to know the value exactly.}

	\item[estimate/measurement]{The value calculated from our data.  This may be 
		as simple as recording a value off of some device, or it may involve
		recording multiple variables, multiple times, and making some computations
		with that data.}  

	\item[error]{The difference between the estimate and the estimand.  Because we don't
		know the estimand exactly, we can't know the error exactly either.  But thinking
		about what the error could be is a big part of understanding the statistical
		properties of an estimation method.  Generally, we want methods where errors 
		tend to be small (so our estimate is ``likely to be close to the estimand")
		and centered around 0 (so we're ``right on average").}
	\item
		[systematic (component of) error]{a component of error that leads our estimate
		to be an over- or under-estimate.  Example: neglecting the weight of the sack will
		lead us to overestimate the weight of the dimes, and therefore overestimate 
		the number of dimes.  This is sometimes expressed as ``a tendency to be off in
		a certain direction."}
	\item
		[random (component of) error]{a component of error that leads to variability
		in estimates.  If random errors are larger, there will be more variability 
		in estimates, so we will be less confident that the estimand and estimate are 
		close together -- although this may still happen by chance.}
\end{description}

One of the big questions in statistics is this:  
\emph{What does our estimate tell us about the estimand?}
We will eventually learn techniques for quantifying (and attempting to reduce)
the effects of error in our measurements.
