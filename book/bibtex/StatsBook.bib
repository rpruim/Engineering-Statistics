@article{Benford38,
	abstract = {It has been observed that the first pages of a table of common
	  logarithms show more wear than do the last pages, indicating that more
		used numbers begin with the digit 1 than with the digit 9. A
		compilation of some 20,000 first digits taken from widely divergent
		sources shows that there is a logarithmic distribution of first digits
		when the numbers are composed of four or more digits. An analysis of
		the numbers from different sources shows that the numbers taken from
		unrelated subjects, such as a group of newspaper items, show a much
		better agreement with a logarithmic distribution than do numbers from
		mathematical tabulations or other formal data. There is here the
		peculiar fact that numbers that individually are without relationship
		are, when considered in large groups, in good agreement with a
		distribution law-hence the name {"}Anomalous Numbers.{"} A further
		analysis of the data shows a strong tendency for bodies of numerical
		data to fall into geometric series. If the series is made up of numbers
		containing three or more digits the first digits form a logarithmic
		series. If the numbers contain only single digits the geometric
		relation still holds but the simple logarithmic relation no longer
		applies. An equation is given showing the frequencies of first digits
		in the different orders of numbers 1 to 10, 10 to 100, etc. The
		equation also gives the frequency of digits in the second, third...
		place of a multi-digit number, and it is shown that the same law
		applies to reciprocals. There are many instances showing that the
		geometric series, or the logarithmic law, has long been recognized as a
		common phenomenon in factual literature and in the ordinary affairs of
		life. The wire gauge and drill gauge of the mechanic, the magnitude
		scale of the astronomer and the sensory response curves of the
		psychologist are all particular examples of a relationship that seems
		to extend to all human affairs. The Law of Anomalous Numbers is thus a
		general probability law of widespread application.},

	  converge to the logarithmic (Benford) distribution. This helps explain

@book{Knuth:art2,
	abstract = {{Volume 2 of Donald Knuth's classic series The Art of Computer
	  Programming covers seminumerical algorithms, with topics ranging from
		random number generators to floating point operations and other
		optimized arithmetic algorithms. Truly comprehensive and meticulously
		written, this book (and series) is that rarest of all creatures--a work
		of authoritative scholarship in classical computer science, but one
		that can be read and used profitably by virtually all working
		programmers.

The book begins with fundamental questions regarding random numbers and how to
use algorithms to generate them. Subsequent chapters demonstrate efficient
computation of single-precision and double-precision arithmetic calculations
and modular arithmetic. The text then presents prime factorization (which can
	be used in cryptography, for instance) and algorithms for calculating
fractions. This volume ends with algorithms for polynomial arithmetic and
manipulation of power-series topics, which will benefit those with some
knowledge of calculus.

Throughout this beautifully presented edition, Knuth incorporates hundreds of
useful exercises for trying out the algorithms. These range from simple
problems to larger research project topics. (The book provides answers, where
	appropriate, at the end of the book.) The result is a text that's suitable
for college or graduate-level computer science courses or individual study by
  programmers. Volume 2 is an indispensable part of any working programmer's
	library.}},

Obese women have lower family incomes than women whose weight-for-height is in the "recommended" range. Results for men are weaker and mixed. We find similar results when we compare same-sex siblings in order to control for family background (for example, social class) differences. Differences in economic status by body mass for women increase markedly when we use an earlier weight measure or restrict the sample to persons who were single and childless when the early weight was reported. There is some evidence of labor market discrimination against obese women. Differences in marriage probabilities and spouse's earnings, however, account for 50 to 95 percent of their lower economic status. There is little evidence that obese African American women suffer an economic penalty relative to other African American women.},

	abstract = {The process employed to produce the conversions that take scores from the original SAT scales to recentered scales, in which reference group scores are centered near the midpoint of the score-reporting range, is laid out. For the purposes of this article, SAT Verbal and SAT Mathematical scores were placed on recentered scales, which have reporting ranges of 920 to 980, means of 950, and standard deviations of 11. (The 920-to-980 scale is used in this article to highlight the distinction between it and the old 200-to-800 scale. In actuality, recentered scores were reported on a 200-to-800 scale.) Recentering was accomplished via a linear transformation of normally distributed scores that were obtained from a continuized, smoothed frequency distribution of original SAT scores that were originally on augmented two-digit scales (i.e., discrete scores rounded to either 0 or 5 in the third decimal place). These discrete scores were obtained for all students in the 1990 Reference Group using 35 different editions of the SAT spanning October 1988 to June 1990. The performance of this 1990 Reference Group on the original and recentered scales is described. The effects of recentering on scores of individuals and the 1990 Reference Group are also examined. Finally, recentering did not occur solely on the basis of its technical merit. Issues associated with converting recentering from a possibility into a reality are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Finland-United States Investigation Of NIDDM Genetics
		(FUSION) study aims to identify genetic variants that predispose to
			type 2 diabetes by studying affected sibling pair families from
			Finland. Chromosome 20 showed our strongest initial evidence for
			linkage. It currently has a maximum logarithm of odds (LOD) score
			of 2.48 at 70 cM in a set of 495 families. In this study, we
			searched for diabetes susceptibility variant(s) at 20q13 by
			genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in case and
			control DNA pools. Of 291 SNPs successfully typed in a 7.5-Mb
			interval, the strongest association confirmed by individual
			genotyping was with SNP rs2144908, located 1.3 kb downstream of the
			primary beta-cell promoter P2 of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha
			(HNF4A). This SNP showed association with diabetes disease status
			(odds ratio [OR] 1.33, 95\% CI 1.06-1.65, P = 0.011) and with
			several diabetes-related traits. Most of the evidence for linkage
			at 20q13 could be attributed to the families carrying the risk
			allele. We subsequently found nine additional associated SNPs
			spanning a 64-kb region, including the P2 and P1 promoters and
			exons 1-3. Our results and the independent observation of
			association of SNPs near the P2 promoter with diabetes in a
			separate study population of Ashkenazi Jewish origin suggests that
			variant(s) located near or within HNF4A increases susceptibility to
			type 2 diabetes.},

@article{Morgan2011:WindSpeed,
	abstract = {In planning offshore wind farms, short-term wind speeds play a
	central role in estimating various engineering parameters, such as power
	output, extreme wind load, and fatigue load. Lacking wind speed time series
	of sufficient length, the probability distribution of wind speed serves as
	the primary substitute for data when estimating design parameters. It is
	common practice to model short-term wind speeds with the Weibull
	distribution. Using 10-min wind speed time series at 178 ocean buoy
	stations ranging from 1 month to 20 years in duration, we show that the
	widely-accepted Weibull distribution provides a poor fit to the
	distribution of wind speeds when compared with more complicated models. We
	compare distributions in terms of three different metrics: probability plot
	R2, estimates of average turbine power output, and estimates of extreme
	wind speed. While the Weibull model generally gives larger R2 than any
	other 2-parameter distribution, the bimodal Weibull, Kappa, and Wakeby
	models all show R2 values significantly closer to 1 than the other
	distributions considered (including the Weibull), with the bimodal Weibull
	giving the best fits. The Kappa and Wakeby distributions fit the upper tail
	(higher wind speeds) of a sample better than the bimodal Weibull, but may
	drastically over-estimate the frequency of lower wind speeds. Because the
	average turbine power is controlled by high wind speeds, the Kappa and
	Wakeby estimate average turbine power output very well, with the Kappa
	giving the least bias and mean square error out of all the distributions.
	The 2-parameter Lognormal distribution performs best for estimating extreme
	wind speeds, but still gives estimates with significant error. The fact
	that different distributions excel under different applications motivates
	further research on model selection based upon the engineering parameter of
	interest.},
