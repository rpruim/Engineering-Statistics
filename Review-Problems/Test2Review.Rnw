\begin{problem}
	\Sexpr{name1} and \Sexpr{name2} conduct an experiment to measure the 
	strength of paper plates. Using the same data,
	\Sexpr{name1} creates a \Sexpr{cl1}\% confidence interval for the mean 
	paper plate strength and  \Sexpr{name2} creates a \Sexpr{cl2}\% 
	confidence interval for the mean paper plate strength.
	Whose interval will be wider?
	Explain your reasoning.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	\Sexpr{if(cl1 > cl2) name1 else name2}'s interval will be wider.  
	A larger confidence level requires a wider interval because 
	we must cover the true parameter value for a higher proportion of samples.
	In the formula, this can be seen because $t_*$ will be larger.

\begin{problem}
Here are some terms we have used in class:
statistic, parameter, sample, population, 
estimate, estimand, estimator,
confidence interval,
standard uncertainty, relative uncertainty, standard error,
margin of error, critical value.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Explain each of the terms in your own words.
Where this makes sense, give (or make up) a specific example.
\item
Find pairs or groups of terms that are related somehow and 
explain how they are related.  (Have fun with this, see how many
relationships you can find.)
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
The key here is not to memorize certain phrases but to make sure you have a 
solid understanding of the concepts.

\begin{problem}
	Beth and Sarah are bowlers.  Bowling scores are discrete (whole numbers), 
	but we can model them with a continuous distribution. As a first approximation,
	let's model their bowling scores as with normal distributions.  Use
	the summary information below (based on their last 25 games) 
	to answer some questions about their bowling performance, assuming that
	their performances are independent (a pretty good model for bowling, since
	players do not directly affect each other).

		\item
			What is the probability that \Sexpr{if(version <=2) "Beth" else "Sarah"} scores 
			200 or more?

		\item
			What is the probability that \Sexpr{if(version <=2) "Sarah" else "Beth"} 
			scores 200 or more?
		\item
			If they bowl together as a team, what is the probability that
			their total score is 400 or more?

			Beth will win (i.e., have a higher score than Sarah)?

\begin{problem}
	A 1996 study of Scotch pine specimens reported a 95\% confidence interval
	for the mean elasticity of $14,500 \pm 1100$ MPa for the mean modulus of
	elasticity obtained 1 minute after applying a certain load.

	True or False.  This means that the researchers believe that 95\% of 
	Scotch pine specimens will have an elasticity between
	13,400 and 15,600 MPa.  %\textbf{Explain.}
	
	Explain your reasoning.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	False.  Confidence intervals are about estimating an unknown parameter 
	(in this case the mean elasticity in the population of all Scotch pine trees), 
	not about containing a large fraction of the population.
	
	Note: It is also important to understand what the confidence level measures.
	A 95\% confidence interval makes a claim not about all possible samples
	in the situation at hand.  95\% of samples should produce intervals that 
	cover the estimand (and 5\% should fail to do so).  We won't know for any
	particular interval whether it contains the estimand or not.
\end{solution}


% \begin{problem}
% 	\textsc{True or False.}
% 	An article reports a 95\% confidence interval for 
% 	mean weight (in pounds) of adult males in a certain 
% 	geographical region to be $180\pm 15$.  This means
% 	that approximately 95\% of the adult males in that area weigh
% 	between 165 and 195 pounds.
% 	\vfill
% \end{problem}
% \begin{solution}
% 			False.  Key things to note:
% 			\begin{itemize}
% 			\item the 95\% refers to 95\% of \emph{samples}, not 95\% of the population
% 			and not 95\% of the sample.
% 			\item
% 			A ``good" confidence interval contains the estimand.  (When an interval
% 			is good, we say it \emph{covers} the estimand.)
% 			\item
% 			For 95\% of samples, the resulting confidence interval should be ``good".
% 			That is, the method has a 95\% coverage rate.
% 			\item
% 			Of course, we can't know for any given data set whether the resulting
% 			interval covers the estimand or not.
% 			\end{itemize}

% \begin{problem}
% \textsc{True or False.}
% When fitting a least squares regression line, it doesn't matter
% which variable is the response and which is the explanatory -- we get the 
% same results either way.
% 
% \end{problem}
% \begin{solution}
% False.  Graphically, the residuals are veritical differences between observed
% response values and the line, so switching the roles of the variables 
% results in a different best fitting line.  (If you fit one way and then simply
% solve the equation for the ``wrong" variable you do NOT get the same line
% as when you fit with the variables in their proper roles.)  Also, all of the 
% machinery (confidence intervals and prediction intervals for the response, for example) in statistical packages is set up to predict the response from the 
% explanatory variables.
% \end{solution}

@
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
In linear modeling, what is the difference between a confidence interval
and a prediction interval for the response?  How do you get R to calculate
them for you?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
For a confidence interval, the estimand is the mean response (for a given value
of the predictor variable).  For a prediction interval, the estimand is the response
value for a single new observation (for a given value of the predictor variable).
\end{solution}

% \begin{problem}
% \textsc{True or False.}
% When the correlation coefficient is large ($r > .9$), there is no need to look
% at a scatter plot because there must be a strong linear relationship between
% the two variables.

\def\Partial#1#2{\frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2}}

\begin{solution}

% There were four versions of this problem.  You can use the table below to
% find the solution for you version.  All of them use the Delta Method formala

\[
u_v = 
\sqrt{ \left(\Partial{v}{s}\right)^2 u_s^2

where $v = \frac{s}{t}$,
$\Partial{v}{s} = \frac{1}{t}$, and
$\Partial{v}{t} = \frac{-s}{t^2}$.
