\chapter{Propagation of Uncertainty}
\label{chap:propagation}% 

\myindex{uncertainty|defidx}
You have probably been told (in physics labs, for example) to report all measurements
along with an \term{uncertainty}.  The reporting often uses the notation:

\[ \mbox{measurement} \pm \mbox{uncertainty} \;. \]
%
But what is uncertainty and how is it calculated?  These are topics for this chapter.

\section{Error and Uncertainty}
Although many people mistakenly conflate the terms \term{error} and \term{uncertainty}, 
these are two different, but related concepts.  
The word ``error" in the context of scientific measurement has a rather
different meaning from its use in everyday English. It does not mean blunder or
goof (although a blunder or goof could increase the amount of experimental error). 
Instead, error refers to the unavoidable fact that
the measurements scientists record are not exactly correct.


Error is easily defined:

\begin{boxedText}
	\[ \mbox{error} = \mbox{estimate} - \mbox{estimand} \]
or, equivalently,
	\[ \mbox{error} = \mbox{measurement} - \mbox{measurand} \]
\end{boxedText}
That is, error is the difference between the number we have measured or calculated and the 
number that calculation is attempting to estimate.  In most applications, we do not know 
the error exactly, because we do not know the estimand.  This is where uncertainty comes in.

\term{Uncertainty} is a numerical measure summarizing how large the error \emph{might be}.  There are several different types, or definitions, or uncertainty.  The different definitions of uncertainty have in common that they are all trying to describe a statistical distribution of errors.  
% Typically, we arrange things so that the mean
% of this distribution is 0 (so that on average our estimates will be correct).  
Knowing something about this distribution
of the errors can tell us how close our estimates tend to be to the estimand.

We will use \term{standard uncertainty} unless we say otherwise.
\begin{boxedText}
	\term{Standard uncertainty} is the (estimated) standard deviation of 
	the distribution of errors.
\end{boxedText}
You may wonder how we can know the distribution of errors when we cannot know the error.
That is a good question, which we will begin to address via an example.

\section{An Example: Estimating the number of dimes in a sack of dimes}
<<dimes,include = FALSE,tidy = FALSE>>=
B <- 10200; B
D <- mean( ~ mass, data = Dimes); D
uB <- 100/sqrt(12); uB
sD <- sd( ~ mass, data = Dimes); sD 
uD <- sd( ~ mass, data = Dimes) / sqrt( nrow(Dimes) ); uD
u <- sqrt( 1/D^2 * uB^2 + B^2/D^4 * uD^2  )
@

Suppose you want to estimate the number of dimes in a large sack of dimes.  Here is one method
you could use:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Measure the weight of all the dimes in the bag by placing them (without the bag)
		on an appropriately sized scale.  (Call this $\hat B$, our estimate for $B$,
		the actual weight of the dimes in the bag.)
	\item
		Measure the weight of 30 individual dimes and use those measurements to
		estimate the mean weight of dimes. (Call this $\hat D$.)
	\item
		Combine these two estimates to compute an estimated number of dimes in the bag.
		($\hat N = \hat B / \hat D$.)
\end{enumerate}

Suppose that the dimes in our our bag together weigh 10.2 kg and the mean weight of our 30 
measured dimes is \Sexpr{mean( ~ mass, data = Dimes)}. 
Then we would estimate the number of dimes to be 
\[
10200 / \Sexpr{mean( ~ mass, data = Dimes)} = \Sexpr{ 10200 / mean( ~ mass, data = Dimes) } \;.
\]
But how good is this estimate?  Do we expect to be within a small handful of dimes?  Might we be 
off by 100 or 500?  Standard uncertainty provides a way to quantify this.  But first, 
we need to calculate uncertainty for the two ingredients in this recipe: 
the total weight of all the dimes in the bag ($\hat B$), and the mean weight of the 
30 measured dimes ($\hat D$).

\subsection{Calculating a Standard Uncertainty without Using Data}

We only measure the bag of dimes once (and might expect that the value
observed on the digital read out would be the same if we measured it repeatedly
anyway), so the distribution involved in our uncertainty calculation will be 
based on some assumptions about the workings of our scale.  For example, we could
model a reading of 10.2 kg with
a $\Unif(10.15, 10.25)$-distribution.\footnote{Other models are possible, and the choice of 
model matters for the uncertainty calculation that will result.}  
This model reflects the assumption that if the actual weight is anywhere between 10.15 and 10.25,
the reading will be 10.2 and that the actual weight is equally likely to be anywhere within
that range.

If we interpret the 10.2 reading in this way, then the uncertainty can be
calculated as the standard deviation of a $\Unif(10.15, 10.25)$-distribution:  

\[
u_{\hat B} = \frac{b-a}{\sqrt{12}} 
= \frac{10.25-10.15}{\sqrt{12}} 
= \frac{0.1}{\sqrt{12}} 
= \Sexpr{0.1/sqrt(12)} kg
= \Sexpr{1000 * 0.1/sqrt(12)} g
\]

\subsection{Calculating a Standard Uncertainty Using Data}

The situation for our estimated mean weight of a dime is a little different.  We weighed 30 dimes, 
and calculated the mean mass of one dime from those data.  But if we repeated the measurements many times -- 
taking another 30 dimes, calculating the average...taking \emph{another} 30 dimes, calculating 
\emph{another} average...and so on many times...how much variability would there be in the 
\emph{calculated averages}? 
We will learn how to estimate this quantity ourselves soon; for now, 
we will take it as a given that it is $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$, 
where $s$ is the standard deviation of one sample (the masses of 30 dimes), and $n$ is the sample 
size (here, 30). So the uncertainty in our mean dime weight is about:
% First, note that we measured the masses of 30 individual dimes, so
% we have data that can tell us something about the variability in the weights of dimes.  
% This would not be the case if we simply measured all 30 dimes at once and
% divided by 30 to get the average.  Second, we are interested in how accurately we can
% estimate the mean weight of the dimes in the sack, 
% not in how accurately we can estimate the weight of any particular dime.  
% df_stats( ~ mass, data = Dimes)
%

\[
u_{\hat D} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} 
= \frac{\Sexpr{sD}}{\sqrt{30}} 
= \Sexpr{uD}\;.
\]
So we would report our estimate for the mean weight of a dime as 
\[
\Sexpr{D} \pm \Sexpr{uD} \;.
\]

\subsection{Propagating Error by the Delta Method}
Now that we have computed the uncertainties for $B$ and $D$, we need to find a way to combine
them to determine the uncertainty for $B/D$.  For this we use a linear approximation of the function $f(B,D) = B/D$.

Recall from calculus that 
\[
f(x,y) \approx f(a, b)
+
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} (x-a)
+
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} (y-b) \;,
\]
where the partial derivatives are evaluated at $(x,y) = (a,b)$.

If we apply this to our estimators $\hat B$ and $\hat D$, we get
\[
f(\hat B,\hat D) \approx f( B, D ) 
+
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat B} (\hat B- B)
+
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat D} (\hat D- D)
\;.
\]
\iffalse
\[
f(\hat B,\hat D) \approx f( \mu_{\hat B}, \mu_{\hat D}) 
+
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat B} (\hat B-\mu_{\hat B})
+
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat D} (\hat D-\mu_{\hat D})
\;.
\]
\fi
%where the partial derivatives are evaluated at $(\hat B, \hat D) = (B,D)$.

From this it follows that
\begin{align*}
	\E(f(\hat B,\hat D)) &\approx 
	\E\left(f( B, D)\right)
+
\E\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial {\hat B}} (\hat B- B) \right)
+
\E\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat D} (\hat D- D) \right)
\\
&\approx f(B,D) + 0 + 0 
\\
&= f(B,D) \;.
\end{align*}
(The 0's come because our estimators are approximately unbiased: $\E(\hat B) \approx B$ and $\E(\hat D) \approx D$.)
This says that $\hat B/ \hat D$ is a reasonable estimate for $B/D$ -- it is approximately
unbiased.\footnote{There is a small sleight of hand here.  Technically, we should evaluate
the partial derivatives at the unknown values $B$ and $D$.  We will instead plug in our 
particular estimates (from our data) for $\hat B$ and $\hat D$.  To denote all of this 
completely rigorously, we would need to have separate notation for $\hat B$ considered
as a random variable (that has an expected value and variance) and as a number (the value
computed from our particular data).  We're avoiding this extra layer of notation.}

But we really want an expression for the uncertainty -- the variance (which we will turn into a standard deviation).  We use similar logic to the expectation calculation above, and we will need to use the finding (not proven here) that for constants $a$ and $b$ and random variable $X$, $Var(aX+b) = a^2 Var(X)$. Assuming $\hat B$ and $\hat D$ are independent,\footnote{A more general formula
can approximate the propagation of uncertainty in cases where $\hat B$ and $\hat D$ 
cannot be assumed to be independent.} a reasonable assumption in this situation,
we get
\begin{align*}
	\\[5mm]
\Var(f(\hat B,\hat D))
&\approx 
\Var\left(f( B, D)\right)
+
\Var\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat B} (\hat B - B) \right)
+
\Var\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat D} (\hat D - D) \right)
\\
&=
0 
+
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat B}\right)^2 \Var(\hat B)
+
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat D}\right)^2 \Var(\hat D)
\end{align*}
where again we evaluate the partial derivatives with $\hat{B}$ and $\hat{D}$.

Applying this to $f(\hat B,\hat D) = \hat B/\hat D$, we get
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat B} &= \frac{1}{\hat D}
	\\
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat D} &= \frac{-\hat B}{\hat D^2}
\end{align*}
So our uncertainty for the estimated number of dimes (remember, we want the standard deviation, which will be the square root of the variance estimate we just derived) is
\[
\sqrt{
\frac{1}{\Sexpr{D}^2} \cdot \Sexpr{uB}^2 
+ \left(\frac{\Sexpr{round(B,4)}}{\Sexpr{D}^2}\right)^2 \cdot \Sexpr{uD}^2}
=
\Sexpr{u} \;,
\]
and we would report our estimated number of dimes as 
\[ 
\Sexpr{round(B/D)} \pm \Sexpr{round(u)} \; \mbox{dimes} \;.
\]

\myindex{Delta Method|defidx}%
The method described in this example is generally referred to as the
\term{Delta Method}.  Often scientists and engineers who are using this method don't use the hat notation
to distinguish between estimates/estimators and estimands.  In the box below, we've 
dropped the hats.

\begin{boxedText}
	\centerline{\textsf{\bfseries The Delta Method for independent estimates}}

	\medskip

	Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent estimates with uncertainties $u_{X}$ and $u_{Y}$,  
	and let $W = f(X,Y)$.
	Then the uncertainty in the estimate for $W$ can be estimated as 
	\[
	u_{W} \approx
	\sqrt{ 
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial X}\right)^2 u_X^2
+
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial Y}\right)^2 u_Y^2
	}
	\]
	where the partial derivatives are evaluated using estimated values of $X$ and $Y$.

	\medskip

	The Delta Method can be extended to functions of more (or fewer) than two variables by
	adding (or removing) terms.  Slightly more complicated formulas exist to handle
	situations where the estimators are not independent (but we will not cover those in this course).

	\medskip
	Because this method is based on using a linear approximation to $f$, it works better
	when the linear approximation is better.  In particular, when
	$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X^2}$ or
	$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial Y^2}$ are large near the estimated 
	values of $X$ and $Y$, the approximations might not be very good.
\end{boxedText}

\subsection{Estimating Uncertainty via Simulations}

We can also estimate the uncertainty in the estimated number of dimes using simulations.

<<dimes-sim,cache = TRUE>>=
B <- runif(10000, 10150, 10250)
SampleMeans <- do(10000) * mean( ~ mass, data = resample(Dimes) )
head(SampleMeans ,3)
D <- SampleMeans$mean
N <- B / D
histogram( ~ N)
gf_qq( ~ N)
sd(N)
@
A few explanatory notes regarding the computation above.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		\function{resample()} samples from a data frame \emph{with replacement}.  That is,
		some of the rows may appear more than once, others not at all.  Resampling
		is a common way to estimate a sampling distribution from a single sample.
		\function{resample()} can also be used on a ``bare" vector (that is, a vector of data points not contained within a data frame, as exemplified below).

<<>>=
resample(1:10)    # some items may be chosen more than once
sample(1:10)      # no item may be chosen more than once, so this just shuffles
shuffle(1:10)     # this also shuffles
@
\item
	When \function{do()} doesn't know what to call the result of what it is ``doing'', it
	calls it \variable{result}.  (Sometimes \function{do()} can figure out a better name.)
\item
	The simulated distribution of $N = B/D$ is unimodal, roughly symmetric, and reasonably 
	well approximated by a normal distribution (but clearly not exactly normal).  
	The Delta Method does not guarantee
	that the distribution will be approximately normal -- it only estimates the 
	variance.  Sometimes the distribution will be skewed or have heavier or lighter
	tails than a normal distribution.
\item
	The results of the Delta Method and simulation are very close.  Each is an acceptable method for approximating 
	the same thing, so this is not surprising.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reporting Measurements and Estimates}

\subsection{What to record, What to report}
 
When you record the results of a measurement for which there is an \emph{a priori}
estimate of uncertainty,  the uncertainty should be recorded along with
the measurement itself.  Similarly, reports of quantities estimated from data
should also include estimated uncertainties.

As a general guideline, a properly reported scientific estimated quantity includes 
the following five elements: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item A number (the estimate)
\item Units (e.g., m  or kg or seconds) 
\item A statement about how it was measured or calculated 
\item A statement about most likely sources of (the largest components of) error
\item An estimate of the uncertainty
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
If you measured the length of a pendulum using a meter stick, you
might report the measurement this way: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item
		Length $= 0.834 \pm 0.002$ m 
	\item
Measured with a meter stick from pivot point to the center of the steel weight. 

	\item
Uncertainty reflects the limited accuracy of measurement with a meter stick.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
In plots, the number is given by the scales of the plot, the units are typically included
in the axes labels, uncertainties may be represented by ``error bars", and a statement 
describing the method of measurement or calculation should appear in the plot legend.
 
\subsection{How many decimal places?}
 
Numerical values and their uncertainties should be recorded to the proper number of
decimal places.  Most software either reports too many significant digits or
rounds numbers too much.  For 
correct professional presentation of your data, follow these guidelines:
%rules \cite[Section 2.2]{Taylor}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
The experimental uncertainty should be rounded to one significant 
figure unless the leading digit is a 1, in which case, it is generally better to use two digits.
\item
A measurement should be displayed to the same number of decimal places as the 
uncertainty on that measurement.  
\end{enumerate}
Note carefully the difference between significant figure and decimal place.  
The following examples will help: 

\begin{example}
The timer reports a value of 0.3451 seconds.  The uncertainty on
the measurement is 0.0038 seconds.    
By Rule 1, the uncertainty should be
reported to one significant figure, so we round it to 0.004 seconds.   
By Rule 2, the measurement must also be rounded to the third decimal place.  Thus, the
measurement should be reported as $0.345\pm0.004$ seconds. 
\end{example}
 
                                                 
\begin{example} 
The measured value is $7.92538 \cdot 10^4$, 
and its uncertainty is $2.3872 \cdot 10^2$.    By Rule 1, 
the uncertainty should be rounded to one significant figure, so 
$2 \cdot 10^2$.  
By Rule 2, we report the 
measurement to the same decimal place as the uncertainty, so $7.93 \cdot 10^4$.  
Putting it together, the 
measurement should be reported as $(7.93\pm0.02) 10^4$.   
\end{example}
 
 
\begin{example} 
The estimated value is $89.231$, 
and its uncertainty is $0.1472$.    By Rule 1, 
the uncertainty should be rounded to two significant figures, so $0.15$.
By Rule 2, we report the 
estimate to the same decimal place as the uncertainty, so $89.23  \pm  0.15$.  
\end{example}

%For more on reporting uncertainties and rounding, see section \ref{sec:3F}
 

\subsection{Reporting numbers in a table}
 
Multiple similar measurements should be reported in a table.  The column
headings should clearly and concisely indicate the quantity in each column; the
column heading must include the units.   Uncertainties should be listed in a
separate column, located just to the right of the measurement column.  (Sometimes, uncertainties are listed in parentheses after the estimate instead; just make sure the header and legend of the table makes it clear what values are being reported, and where.) 

\begin{example}
A lab group calculated these numbers for kinetic energy and its uncertainty: 

\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
  \hline
Kinetic Energy & uncertainty 
\\
\hline
0.8682 & 0.059 
\\
1.0661 & 0.071 
\\
1.0536 & 0.070 
\\
1.3881 & 0.058 
\\
0.8782 & 0.108 
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center} 

This should be reported with appropriate rounding as

\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
  \hline
Kinetic Energy & uncertainty 
\\
\hline
0.87 & 0.06 
\\
1.07 & 0.07 
\\
1.05 & 0.07 
\\
1.39 & 0.06 
\\
0.88 & 0.11 
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center} 
\end{example}


 



\section{Additional Propagation of Uncertainty Examples}
\label{sec:propagationExamples}%

\begin{example}
	\question
	The side of a square is measured and reported as $12.3 \pm 0.2$ mm.
	How should the area be reported?

	\answer
	Our estimate for the area is $12.3^2 = \Sexpr{12.3^2}$. 
	Our transformation is $f(x) = x^2$, so $\Partial{f}{x} = f'(x) = 2x$.  
	Applying the Delta Method, our uncertainty is

	\[
	\sqrt{ (2 (12.3))^2 (0.2)^2 } = 2 (12.3)(0.2) = \Sexpr{2 * 12.3 * 0.2}
	\]
	and we report the area as
	$\Sexpr{round(12.3^2,0)} \pm \Sexpr{signif(2*12.3*0.2,1)}$.

	It is worth looking at the relative uncertainty of the linear and area measurements.
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{0.2}{12.3} &= \Sexpr{0.2 / 12.3}
		\\
		\frac{\Sexpr{signif(2 *12.3*0.2,1)}}{\Sexpr{round(12.3^2,0)}} 
		&= \Sexpr{signif(2 * 12.3 * 0.2 / 12.3^2, 3)}
	\end{align*}
So the relative uncertainty of the area measurement is twice the relative uncertainty
of the linear measurement.
\end{example}

The preceding example demonstrates a simplified version of the Delta Method formula 
when we are dealing with only one estimator.

\begin{boxedText}
	\centerline{\textsf{\bfseries The Delta Method for one estimator}}

	Let $X$ be an estimator with uncertainty $u_{X}$ and let $\hat W = f(\hat X)$.
	Then the uncertainty in the estimate $W$ can be estimated as 
	\[
	u_{W} \approx
\left|\frac{df}{dX}\right| u_X
	\]
	where the derivative is evaluated using the estimated value of $X$, $\hat{X}$.
\end{boxedText}



\begin{example}
\label{example:box1}
	\question
	The sides of a rectangle are measured and reported as $12.3 \pm 0.2$ mm and
	$6.3 \pm 0.1$ mm.
	How should the area be reported?

	\answer
	Our estimate for the area is $12.3 \cdot 6.3 = \Sexpr{12.3 * 6.3}$.  

	Now we need to estimate the uncertainty.
	Our transformation is $f(x,y) = xy$, so   $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = y$ and 
	$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x$. 
\[
\sqrt{ 6.3^2 \cdot 0.2^2 + 12.3^2 \cdot 0.1^2 } =
\Sexpr{sqrt(6.3^2 * 0.2^2 + 12.3^2 * 0.1^2) } 
\]
and we should report the area as 
\[
\Sexpr{round(6.3 * 12.3,1)} \pm 
	\Sexpr{signif(sqrt(6.3^2 * 0.2^2 + 12.3^2 * 0.1^2),2)} 
\]
%or
%\[
%\Sexpr{round(6.3 * 12.3,0)} \pm \Sexpr{signif(sqrt(6.3^2 * 0.2^2 + 12.3^2 * 0.1^2),1)} 
%\]
\end{example}

\myindex{relative uncertainty}%
Sometimes it is more convenient to think about \term{relative uncertainty}:

\begin{boxedText}
\centerline{\textsf{\bfseries Absolute and relative uncertainty}}
\medskip

\[
\mbox{relative uncertainty} 
= \frac{ \mbox{uncertainty of measurement} }{\mbox{magnitude of measurement}}
\]
For example, if we measure a mass to be $10.2$ g with an uncertainty of $0.3$ g, the 
relative uncertainty is 
\[
\frac{0.3}{10.2} 
= \Sexpr{0.3/10.2}
= \Sexpr{round(100 * 0.3/10.2,1)} \%
\]
Often it is the case that uncertainty grows with the magnitude of the estimate, and relative uncertainty
is a way of comparing the uncertainty in large measured values with the uncertainty of 
small measured values on a more equal basis.  Relative uncertainty is also independent 
of the units used.
\end{boxedText}

In the example above, we get a nice formula if we compute relative uncertainty
instead of absolute uncertainty.  Let $P = XY$ where $X$ and $Y$ have
uncertainties $u_X$ and $u_Y$.  Then $\Partial{P}{X} = Y$ and $\Partial{P}{Y} =
X$, so

\begin{align*}
\frac{u_P}{P} 
& = \sqrt{ \frac{ Y^2 u_X^2 + X^2 u_Y^2}{P^2} }
\\
& = \sqrt{ \frac{ Y^2 u_X^2 + X^2 u_Y^2}{X^2Y^2} }
\\
& = \sqrt{ \frac{ u_X^2}{X^2} + \frac{u_Y^2}{Y^2} }
\\
& = \sqrt{ \left(\frac{ u_X}{X}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{u_Y}{Y}\right)^2 }
\end{align*}
which gives a Pythagorean identity for the relative uncertainties.

The computations are the same for any product.  
So this Pythagorean identity for relative uncertainties can be 
applied to estimate uncertainties for quantities such as 
area (length $\times$ width), 
work (force $\times$ distance), 
distance (velocity $\times$ time), etc.

\begin{example}
	\question
	Use relative uncertainty to estimate the area of the rectangle 
	in 	Example~\ref{example:box1}.

	\answer
	The relative uncertainties in the length and width are 
	\[ 
	\frac{0.2}{12.3} = \Sexpr{0.2/12.3} \tand 
	\frac{0.1}{6.3} = \Sexpr{0.1/6.3} 
	\;.
	\]
	So the relative uncertainty in the area estimation is 
	\[
	\sqrt{ 
	(\Sexpr{0.2/12.3})^2 +  (\Sexpr{0.1/6.3})^2 }
	=
	\Sexpr{ sqrt((0.2/12.3)^2 +  (0.1/6.3)^2) }
	\;.
	\]
	Now we solve 
	\[
	\frac{u_A}{77.49} = \Sexpr{ sqrt((0.2/12.3)^2 +  (0.1/6.3)^2) }
	\]
	to get 
	\[
	u_A = (77.49) (\Sexpr{ sqrt((0.2/12.3)^2 +  (0.1/6.3)^2) }) =
	\Sexpr{ 77.49 * sqrt((0.2/12.3)^2 +  (0.1/6.3)^2) } 
	\;.
	\]
	Notice that this matches the result from 
	Example~\ref{example:box1}.

\end{example}

\begin{example}
	\question
	When two resistors with resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$ are connected in parallel, 
	the combined resistance satisfies
	\[
	R = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} 
	\]
	Suppose the resistances of the two resistors are reported as 
	$20 \pm 0.7$ ohms and $50 \pm 1.2$ ohms.  How should you report the combined resistance?

	\answer
	Our estimate is $\hat R = \frac{ 20 \cdot 50}{ 20 + 50} = \Sexpr{20*50/(20 + 50)}$.
	To estimate the uncertainty, we need the partial derivatives 
	$\Partial{R}{R_1}$ and $\partial{R}{R_2}$.

	\begin{align*}
		\Partial{R}{R_1} &= \frac{ (R_1+R_2)R_2 - (R_1 R_2) }{(R_1 + R_2)^2}
		\\
		&= \left( \frac{ R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\right)^2 
		\\
		&= \left( \frac{ 50}{20 + 50}\right)^2  = \Sexpr{(50/70)^2}
	\end{align*}
	Similarly,
	\begin{align*}
		\Partial{R}{R_2} 
		&= \left( \frac{ R_1}{R_1 + R_2}\right)^2
		\\
		&= \left( \frac{ 20}{20 + 50}\right)^2 = \Sexpr{( 20 / 70 )^2}
	\end{align*}
<<resistors,include = FALSE>>=
R <- 20*50/(20 + 50)
u1 <- 0.7; u2 <- 1.2
p1 <- (50/70)^2; p2 <- (20/70)^2
u <- sqrt( p1^2 * u1^2 + p2^2 *u2^2 )
r <- 1 + round(-log10(u))
@
	So our estimated uncertainty is given by
\[
	u_R = \sqrt{ (\Sexpr{p1})^2 (\Sexpr{u1})^2 + (\Sexpr{p2})^2)(\Sexpr{u2}^2) }
	= \Sexpr{u} \;.
\]
So we report the combined resistance as 

\[
\Sexpr{round(R,r)} \pm \Sexpr{round(u,r)}
\]

\end{example}


\section{Experimental Error and Its Causes} % Taylor ref here 2 
There are many reasons for experimental error, and it is important to identify
potential causes for experimental error, to reduce their effects when possible,
and to handle them appropriately in any case.


\subsection{Random error: Same procedure, different results}

Even if measurements are taken by carefully trained scientists using
highly precise instruments, repeated measurements of the ``same thing"
may not always give the same value.

All data collection is done in the context of variability,
and statistics allows us to interpret our data in this context.


\subsubsection{The moving target}
One reason that a measurement may change is that what we are measuring
may be changing.  Some quantities depend on environmental factors (like 
temperature and atmospheric pressure, for example) that may change
between measurements.   This sort of variability can often be reduced
by attempting to  control factors that might lead to such variability.
For example, a delicate experiment might be conducted in a
climate controlled chamber.
Another solution is to use a model that includes additional variables 
for these quantities.  Often a combination of these two approaches is used.

If measurements are made using similar (but not identical) objects, then
differences among those objects may lead to variability in measurements.   If
measurements are made on a sample of living things, the variability from one
individual to the next could be quite large.  But even in the physical
sciences, each run of an experiment may require the use of different
``consumables'' that have slightly different properties that affect 
our measurements.

\iffalse
\subsubsection{Measurement error}

Another source of variability is the measuring process itself.  Every
measurements are made on a sample of living things, the variability from one
individual to the next could be quite large.  But even in the physical
sciences, each run of an experiment may require the use of different
``consumables'' that have slightly different properties that affect 
our measurements.
\fi


\subsubsection{Measurement error}

Another source of error is the measuring process itself.  Every
measuring device has its limits, as do the humans who are using them.
If you repeatedly timed how long it takes for a steel ball to fall from a fixed 
height, it is quite likely 
that you would not get exactly the same result each time.  The amount of 
variability would likely increase if several different students were 
each asked to measure the time as different students
might employ slightly different methods, or be more or less skillful in 
their measuring.

The variability from one measurement to another that would exist even if there
were no moving target effect is called \term{measurement error}.  In practice,
it can be difficult or impossible to isolate the moving target effect from
measurement error, so they may be combined into one source of variability which
we will call 
\term{random error}.
In physics, the moving target effect is often small -- at least in carefully
designed experiments -- so that random error is dominated by the 
difficulties of measuring the quantity under study.  In other disciplines,
the relative magnitudes may be reversed.

The best way to estimate the effects of random error is by making repeated
measurements and comparing them.  The \term{discrepancies} (differences between
measurements) provide an indication of the amount of random error.  

Sometimes
additional information can also be used to help us estimate random error.  This
can be especially important when our ability to take repeated measurements is
limited or when limitations of our measurement apparatus make it impossible
to directly observe the effects of random error.

\subsubsection{Invisible measurement error}
Although there is no theoretical limit to the precision of a numerical quantity 
like mass, time, velocity, etc., every measurement device has limited precision.
Because of this lack of precision in our measurement device, it may well be 
that repeated measuremets will all look identical.  
\emph{But this does not mean that they are exactly correct.}  

For example,
if we measure temperature using a digital thermometer that has a display
showing tenths of a degree C, then any temperature between 57.15 and 57.25 will
be displayed as 57.2.  Any variability within that range will be invisible to
our thermometer.
Similarly, if we meaure with a ruler with a 1/8 inch scale, we can
use interpolation to get not only to the nearest 1/8 inch, but likely to the 
nearest 1/16 inch or (with some practice) perhaps to the nearest 1/32 inch.  But
beyond that, we really cannot tell.  If more precise measurements are required,
a different measuring tool will need to be used.

If other sources of variability are small, this kind of measurement error 
may completely mask them.

\subsection{Systematic error: A tendency to over- or under-estimate}
Even if your target were not moving, and even if there were no 
variability in measurements from time to time, and even if our measurement
apparatus were perfectly precise, there is still
a chance that a measurement might not give the value we are searching 
for because the procedure used might tend to give results that over-
or under-estimate the quantity being measured.  This kind of error may be referred to as either \term{bias} or \term{systematic error}.


\begin{boxedText}
	\term{Bias} or \term{Systematic error} refers to the tendency 
to either over- or under-estimate a quantity.  It is a tendency to ``be off 
in a particular direction''.
\end{boxedText}

\subsubsection{Calibration errors}
Perhaps the easiest type of systematic error to understand is \textbf{calibration error}.
If a measuring device is not properly calibrated, the resulting measurements may be 
too large or too small.
For example, if a timing device uses an internal clock that runs a bit slow, it will
tend to underestimate times.  It might be possible to correct for this bias by
performing calibration exercises comparing this timing device to another 
(more accurate) device.  If several similar timing devices systematically
disagree, but there is no reference to calibrate with, then we have evidence
that at least some of the devices are introducing systematic error, but we may
not know which ones or how much.

Calibrating equipment and procedures by using them to measure or compute
standard quantities is an important part of quality scientific experimentation
because it helps reduce the effects of systematic bias.  


\subsubsection{Design flaws}

Poorly designed experiments can also introduce systematic error.  For example,
imagine an experiment where a steel ball is dropped from a platform at
different heights and the time is recorded until the ball hits the ground.  
To save time, the researchers set the platform at a specified height and drop the ball
multiple times before moving the platform to a new height and repeating.
Using this method, any error in measuring the height of the platform will affect all
the drops from that height \emph{in the same way}.  This introduces an unknown amount
of systematic error into the measurements taken at each height.  An alternative design
in which the heights are done in random order and in which the platform height is 
reset before each drop would likely have somewhat more random error but would avoid this
source of systematic error.

\subsubsection{Dealing with systematic error}
Systematic error is generally more difficult to handle than random error in
part because there is often no good way to measure how large systematic error
might be or even to detect that it is occurring.

\subsection{Relative Magnitudes of Errors from Different Sources}

We have identified several potential sources of error.  
%In the next section we will learn
%how to quantify the uncertainty that results.  But even without quantified methods, 
It is good to get in the habit of qualitatively determining which sources you expect to contribute
relatively larger and smaller amounts of error.  Often we can ignore the sources of relatively
smaller potential error and focus our attention on the sources of relatively larger potential
error.


\section{Uncertainty -- How Much Error Might There Be?}

In Section~\ref{sec:propagationExamples} we did several examples of propagation of 
uncertainty.  But uncertainty cannot be propagated to derived estimates unless we already
have estimated uncertainties for the components of the derivation.
Where do these uncertainty estimates come from?

As we have mentioned before, it is not possible to measure error directly.  
% This makes dealing with error a bit tricky.  In our dimes example we illustrated
% two common ways that uncertainty estimates are obtained. 
If we knew the amount of an error exactly, we would correct for it and obtain the exact, correct 
estimate of the value we were trying to measure.  
Since we do not know the error exactly, we have to try to use our data 
(and our prior knowledge about the situation) to try to estimate it. In this section we focus 
our attention on this part of the uncertainty calculation.

\subsection{Looking at variability in your data}

If you have repeated measurements, a histogram, boxplot, or density plot of these 
measurements can provide a 
visual representations that shows both what is ``typical'' or ``average'' and how much 
variability there is in the data.  

\begin{figure}[h]
<<echo = FALSE,out.width = ".3\\textwidth",caption = "Representations of the same 25 measurements">>=
set.seed(1234)
x <- rnorm(25, 10, 2)
histogram(~x, xlab = "",n = 10)
densityplot(~x, xlab = "")
bwplot(~x, xlab = "")
@
\caption{Three graphical representations of the same 25 measurents.}
\end{figure}


In addition, graphical displays of your data may help isolate outliers -- values
that don't seem to fit the pattern of the rest of the data.  Outliers should not be removed
from your data without furhter investigation.  You need to know why these values are 
different from the rest.  Was there a mistake in the measurement?  Was the value recorded
incorrectly (decimal point in the wrong place, wrong units, transposed digits, typo)?
Or was there something different going on -- so that the potential outlier is \emph{really} an important, informative data point that is trying to tell you something about the process you are measuring?  An outlier might be the key observation in 
your data set -- don't throw it away without investigating.

\subsection{Estimating uncertainty from your data}
\label{sec:uncertainty-from-data}

Whenever possible, you should make multiple measurements of the same phenomenon.
The variability among these measurements allows us to estimate the uncertainty.
If we are using the mean of multiple measurements as our estimate, then the uncertainty
is the ``standard error of the mean" (which we will derive in the following chapter):

\[ 
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} 
\]
This is how we estimated the uncertainty in our estimate for the mean weight of a dime.

In other more complicated study designs, some other standard error formula may be used.

\subsection{Estimating uncertainty in other ways}
\label{sec:uncertainty-without-data}
Estimating uncertainty from data is only possible if 
\begin{itemize}
\item You have multiple measurements from which to estimate the variability, and 
\item The measurements actually vary (aren't masked by imprecise measuring devices, 
for example).
\end{itemize}

Frequently, these conditions are not met, but we still want to quantify the uncertainty.

%\subsubsection{Overcoming lack of measurement precision}
\subsubsection{The uniform model for measurement (im)precision}
There are many measuring devises that provide limited precision so that the 
best we may be able to say is that we know the measured value to be in some interval $[a,b]$.
This would be the case for measuring devices with digital displays, for example.  
Imagine a device that displays 8.03 on its digital display.  
Presumably, this means that the actual measurement can lie anywhere between 
8.025 and 8.035.  This value has been rounded for digital display, and we 
have no way of knowing where within that interval the value might be.

We don't want to report the uncertainty as $b-a$ or even $(b-a)/2$.  These would be
overestimates of the ``average" amount of error.
Here, we aren't looking for an upper bound on the potential error; we want to estimate something 
like the average amount of error.

In this case we can estiamte a standard uncertainty based on the \term{uniform distribution}.  
Recall, a uniform
distribution is one in which every value in some interval is ``equally likely''.
A uniform distribution has standard deviation $s = \frac{b-a}{\sqrt{12}}$, so we will
use this as our estimate for standard uncertainty as well.
Notice that 
$\frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \Sexpr{1/sqrt(3)} $.
This means that adding and subtracting one standard uncertainty from the center 
of the interval
\[
\frac{a+b}{2} \pm \frac{b-a}{\sqrt{12}}
\]
will cover about 58\% of the interval.  
This is quite a bit less than the 68\% covered by the central portion of a normal 
distribution (within 1 standard deviation of the mean).
For a ``back of the envelope'' computation, to use an uncertainty with a similar amount of ``coverage" to the ``coverage" that the standard deviation has for the normal distribution, we might choose to use the approximation 
$\frac{b-a}{\sqrt{12}} \approx \frac{b-a}{3}$,
since this will slightly over-estimate the uncertainty and lead to a central covering
probability of $2/3 \approx 68\%$.

This same idea can be used when working with analog scales, but in this case, we typically
can see that the value is closer to one end than the other or closer to the center than
to the edges.  This reduces our uncertainty by a factor of 2.  For example, given a ruler
marked in mm, if we can tell than a reading is closer to 12.3 mm than it is to 12.4 mm, then we 
are saying we know the value is in the interval $[12.3, 12.35]$, which is only half as 
wide as the scale of the ruler.  We can then use a uniform distribution as above, except that the limits $a$ and $b$ of the distribution are a bit narrower now.  
(On some analog scales, it may be possible to do even better than this.)

\begin{example}
Measuring length on a ruler with a 1 mm scale, we could use $\frac{1/2}{\sqrt{12}}$
as the estimated uncertainty of the measurement if the primary source of error is reading
the scale.  Of course, it may be that lining up the scale with the object being measured
introduces more uncertainty than reading the scale does.  That may lead us to choose a 
larger value for our estimated uncertainty.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Other models for measurement (im)precision}
Other distributions, most notably the triangle and normal distributions, are sometimes
used instead of the uniform distribution to model errors in measurements made
with various devices.  Each of these models produces a somewhat smaller estimate
for the uncertainty than you would get using a uniform distribution.  In the case of the normal distribution, typically one considers
half the width of the interval to be spanned by 3 standard deviations of the
normal distribution (since that would capture 99.7\% of the distribution.  If $a$ and $b$
are the lower and upper limits of plausible values corresponding to a measurement,
the three uncertainty calculations are as follows:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lc}
		\hline
		distribution & uncertainty
		\\
		\hline
		\\[-3mm]
		uniform & $\displaystyle \frac{b-a}{2 \sqrt{3}}$
		\\[5mm]
		triangle & $\displaystyle \frac{b-a}{2 \sqrt{6}}$
		\\[5mm]
		normal & $\displaystyle \frac{b-a}{2 \cdot 3}$
		\\[3mm]
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This makes the uniform distribution the most conservative and the normal distribution the least conservative.

%Because our uncertainty is based on a standard deviation, we will be able to combine
%it with other uncertainties when we learn about propagation of uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Taking advantage of other data}

Sometimes previous experience with a device or protocol may provide us with a good 
estimate for the uncertainty even before we collect our data.  In such cases, we can 
use these \emph{a priori} uncertainties both in planning and in analysis, but it is also
good to check that the data collected are consistent with the estimated uncertainties.

\begin{problem}
A clinical trial with 30 patients has been performed in
which the volume of distribution 
(the theoretical volume that would be necessary to contain the total 
amount of an administered drug at the same concentration that it is observed 
in the blood plasma) of a new anti-diabetes drug 
was measured for each patient.  The sample mean was 10.2 L with a 
standard deviation of 1.9 L.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Calculate a 95\% confidence interval
for the the mean volume of distribution.
\item
Calculate a 99\% confidence interval
for the the mean volume of distribution.
\item
Calculate the standard uncertainty for the mean volume of distribution.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
<<>>=

# 99 % CI
t.star <- qt(.995, df = 29); t.star
ME <- t.star *  1.9 / sqrt(30); ME

# standard uncertainty = SE = s / sqrt(n)
1.9 / sqrt(30)

\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
A handbook gives the value of the coefficient of linear thermal expansion of 
pure copper at 20 degrees C, $\alpha_{20}$(Cu), as 
$16.52 \times 10^{−6} \ {}^\circ C^{-1}$
and simply states that ``the error in this value should not exceed 
$0.40 \times 10^{−6} \ {}^{\circ} C^{-1}$.''
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Based on this limited information, and assuming a rectangular distribution,
compute the standard uncertainty.
\item
Based on this limited information, and assuming a triangular distribution,
compute the standard uncertainty.
\item
Why might one prefer one of these over the other?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
<<>>=

# triangular: sd = width / (2 * sqrt(6))
0.4 * 2 / (2 * sqrt(6))
0.4 / sqrt(6)
@

The uniform distribution is a more conservative assumption.  The trianlge distribution should only
be used in situations where errors are more likely to be smaller than larger 
(with the the specified bounds).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
The following data are given in in the certificate of a standard solution: 
C(HCl) = ($0.10000 \pm 0.00010$) mol/l. 
No additional information is given on the type of the uncertainty. 
(The $\pm$ part here is not the uncertainty but is supposed to indicate
upper and lower bounds on  the error.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Convert the uncertainty to standard uncertainty assuming a
rectangular distribution.
\item
Convert the uncertainty to standard uncertainty assuming a
triangular distribution.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
The area of a circle is to be calculated from a measured radius.  The measurement and its
standard uncertainty are reported as 
\[
12.5 \pm 0.3 \mbox{m} \;.
\]
What should the researchers report as the area?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Let $f(R) = \pi R^2$.  Then $\Partial{f}{R} = 2\pi R$, so the uncertainty in the area estimation
is 
\[
\sqrt{ (2 \pi R)^2 (0.3)^2 } = 2 \pi R \cdot 0.3  = \Sexpr{2 * pi * 12.5 * 0.3} 
\mathrm{m}^2
\;.
\]
We can report the area as 
$\Sexpr{round(pi * 12.5^2, -1)} \pm \Sexpr{round(2 * pi * 12.5 * 0.3, -1)}$.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
	Below are some computer-computed estimates and uncertainties.  They are far too precise (there are way too
	many digits reported).  Use standard practice to report each estimate with the correct number of digits.

\begin{problem}
	A student is calculating the volume of a rectangular tank by measuring 
	the length, width, and height.  These measurements are recorded as 
	 $L = 2.65 \pm 0.02$cm, $W = 3.10 \pm 0.02$cm, and $H = 4.61\pm 0.05$ cm.

	 How should the volume be reported?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	In a product the relative uncertainties add, so
<<tidy = FALSE>>=
L <- 2.65; W <- 3.10; H <- 4.61
uL <- 0.02; uW <- 0.02; uH <- 0.05
V <- L * W * H; V
uV <- sqrt( (uL/L)^2 + (uW/W)^2 + (uH/H)^2) * V; uV
@
	So we report $\Sexpr{round(V,1)} \pm \Sexpr{round(uV,1)}$

\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
	Estimate (with uncertainty) 
	the amount of gasoline burned by personal cars in a particular
	year in the US from the following estimates and uncertainties for that
	year:

	% note: estimates found online for 2011.  uncertainties made 
	% up but roughly based on the number of digits reported in online sources.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{lrr}
			\hline
			quantity & estimate & uncertainty
			\\
			\hline
			cars per person & 0.80 & 0.12
			\\
			population (millions of people) & 311.6 & .2 
			\\
			fleet fuel efficiency (mpg) & 23.7 & 1.7 
			\\
			average distance driven per vehicle (miles) & 12,000 & 2,000 
			\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

	Note:  Various estimates for these quantities are available online, but 
	most do not report uncertainty.  The uncertainties here reflect the 
	number of significant figures used to report these numbers and the 
	variability between estimates found at different web sites.
	Also, the methodology for determining these values is not always
	clear.  So treat this as an exercise in propagation of error, but 
	understand that better estimates of fuel consumption (and uncertainty)
	would be possible with better data.
\end{problem}


\begin{solution}
The total fuel consumed is given by
\[
F = \frac{kPd}{E}
\]
where $k$ is the cars per person, $P$ is total population, $d$ is average distance 
driven per car, and $E$ is the average efficiency.

\begin{align*}
\Partial{F}{k} &= \frac{Pd}{E} 
\\
\Partial{F}{P} &= \frac{kd}{E}
\\
\Partial{F}{d} &= \frac{kP}{E}
\\
\Partial{F}{E} &= \frac{-kPd}{E^2}
\end{align*}

So the estimated amount of fuel consumed (in millions of gallons) is 
\[
\frac{kPd}{E} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 311.6 \cdot 12000 }{23.7}
= \Sexpr{0.8 * 311.6 * 12000 / 23.7}
\]
and the uncertainty can be computed as follows:
<<tidy = FALSE>>=
k <- 0.8; u_k <- 0.12
P <- 311.6; u_P <- 0.2
d <- 12000; u_d <- 2000
E <- 23.7; u_E <- 1.7
variances <- c(
            (P*d/E)^2 * u_k^2 , 
            (k*d/E)^2 * u_P^2 , 
            (k*P/E)^2 * u_d^2 , 
            (k * P * d/E^2)^2 * u_E^2
)
variances

u_F <- 
  sqrt( 
            (P*d/E)^2 * u_k^2 + 
            (k*d/E)^2 * u_P^2 + 
            (k*P/E)^2 * u_d^2 + 
    (k * P * d/E^2)^2 * u_E^2
    )
u_F
sqrt(sum(variances))
@
\noindent
So we might report fuel consumption as 
\Sexpr{round(0.8 * 311.6 * 12000 / 23.7, -4)} $\pm$ 
\Sexpr{round(u_F, -4)} millions of gallons or 
\Sexpr{round(0.8 * 311.6 * 12000 / 23.7 / 1000, -1)} $\pm$ 
\Sexpr{round(u_F/1000, -1)} billions of gallons.

Note: This problem can also be done in stages.  First we estimate the number 
of (millions of) cars using
\[
C = k P \;.
\]

<<>>=
C <- k * P; C
u_C <- sqrt( P^2 * u_k^2 + k^2 * u_P^2); u_C
@

The number of (millions of) miles driven is estimated by $M = C d$:
<<>>=
M <- C * d; M
u_M <- sqrt( d^2 * u_C^2 + C^2 * u_d^2); u_M
@

Finally, the fuel used is $F = M / E$.
<<>>=
F = M / E
u_F = sqrt( (1/E)^2 * u_M^2 + (M/E^2)^2 * u_E^2); u_F
@

This gives the same result (again in millions of gallons of gasoline).

It would also be possible to relative uncertainty to do this problem, since 
we have nice formulas for the relative uncertainty in products and quotients.

	$1.637 \pm 0.006$ m, how should she report the speed in $m/s$?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	See the next problem for the answer.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
			Work out a formula for the relative uncertainty of $Q = X/Y$ given
			relative uncertainties for $X$ and $Y$.
		\item
			Redo problem~\ref{prob:speed-propagation} using your new formula.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	Let $Q = X Y^{-1}$.  So 
	$\Partial{Q}{X} = Y^{-1}$ and 
	$\Partial{Q}{Y} = -X Y^{-2}$.  From this we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{u_Q}{Q} 
& = \sqrt{ \frac{ Y^{-2} u_X^2 + X^2 Y^{-4} u_Y^2}{Q^2} }
\\
& = \sqrt{ \frac{ Y^{-2} u_X^2 + X^2 Y^{-4} u_Y^2}{X^2Y^{-2}} }
\\
& = \sqrt{ \frac{ u_X^2}{X^2} + \frac{u_Y^2}{Y^2} }
\\
& = \sqrt{ \left(\frac{ u_X}{X}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{u_Y}{Y}\right)^2 }
\end{align*}
which gives a Pythagorean identity for the relative uncertainties just as it 
did for a product.

<<tidy = FALSE>>=
V <- 1.637 / 0.43; V
uV <- sqrt( (0.02/.43)^2 + (0.006/1.637)^2 ) * V; uV
@
So we report
$\Sexpr{round(V,2)} \pm \Sexpr{round(uV,2)}$.
\end{solution}
